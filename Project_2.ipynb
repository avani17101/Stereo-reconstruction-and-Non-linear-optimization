    "    <li> The second project of the course is designed to get you familiar with stereo reconstruction, and non-linear optimization </li>\n",
    "    <li> Use python for this project. PILLOW and OpenCV are permitted for image I/O. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Submit this notebook as a zipped file on moodle. The format should be $<$team_id$>$_$<$team_ name$>$.zip. Both members have to submit this zip file. </li>\n",
    "    <li> A seperate report is not needed if you're coding in the notebook itself. Please provide adequate descriptions of the approaches you've taken. Also mention work distribution for the two members. </li>\n",

    "\n",
    "3-D point clouds are very useful in robotics for several tasks such as object detection, motion estimation (3D-3D matching or 3D-2D matching), SLAM, and other forms of scene understanding.  Stereo camerasprovide  us  with  a  convenient  way  to  generate  dense  point  clouds.Densehere,  in  contrast  tosparse,means all the image points are used for the reconstruction.  In this part of the assignment you will begenerating a dense 3D point cloud reconstruction of a scene from stereo images.\n",

    "    <li> Generate a disparity map for each stereo pair.  Use OpenCV (e.g.  StereoSGBM) for this.  Notethat the images provided are already rectified and undistorted. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Then, using the camera parameters and baseline information generate colored point clouds fromeach disparity map.  Some points will have invalid disparity values, so ignore them.  Use [Open3D]for storing your point clouds. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Register (or transform) all the generated point clouds into your world frame by using the providedground truth poses. </li>\n",

    "    <li> Solve for the pose $T_{k}$ that minimizes this non-linear reprojection error using a Gauss-Newton (GN)scheme.  Recall that in GN we start with some initial estimated value $x_{o}$ and iteratively refine the estimate using $x_{1}$= $∆x+x_0$, where $∆x$ is obtained by solving the normal equations $J^{T}J∆x$= -$J^{T}e$, until convergence.The main steps in this scheme are computing the corresponding Jacobians and updating the estimates correctly.  For our problem,  use a 12×1 vector parameterization for $T_{k}$(the top 3×4submatrix).  Run the optimization for different choices of initialization and report your observations. </li>\n",
